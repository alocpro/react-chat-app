    <h2 class="first" id="1_vestibule">1. Vestibule</h2>

    <p>Five statues depict male figures, wearing archaic Thulian dress. All have the exact same head and face—a haughty, bearded man with piercing eyes. Characters with religious knowledge recognize the figures as gods. Their heads are those of Turms Termax. These heads are not original and a successful force doors check can remove them (see page XX for more information). A sixth statue depicts an attractive but hard-faced woman. She is Sarana, Turms&#8217;s lover, who, legends say, disappeared shortly before his apotheosis.</p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_1">

    <p>I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by religion, both real and imagined. Consequently, when I started thinking about the Dwimmermount campaign, my thoughts quickly turned to that subject. I briefly toyed with the idea of bucking the assumption that fantasy is polytheistic and presenting a monotheistic world instead. In retrospect, I often wish I had gone this route, but, at the time, I was drinking deeply from pulp fantasy literature, particularly Clark Ashton Smith, where polytheism is the norm. So, I set about creating my own pantheon for use in the campaign.</p>

    <p>Looking back on the early history of roleplaying, I noticed that many campaigns used a mishmash of deities swiped from historical religions. I decided I&#8217;d follow suit and cracked open my copy of Gods, Demigods &amp; Heroes to look for suitable gods. One of the first ones I chose was Thoth, the Egyptian deity of knowledge and writing. Even though I was purposefully choosing real world divinities for my setting, I nevertheless wanted to disguise their origins, at least somewhat. I did a little research into Thoth and was reminded that the Greeks equated him with Hermes. </p>

    <p>One of Thoth&#8217;s titles was "thrice great." This title, translated into Greek and transliterated into Latin, became "Trismegistus." Hermes Trismegistus played an important role in many esoteric religions and was associated with magic and alchemy. He was also a major figure in Renaissance and later Hermeticism (which derives its name from him). These connections intrigued me and I thought they&#8217;d be useful in establishing some mysteries about Dwimmermount and the larger setting. After some more research, I discovered that the Etruscans called Hermes Turms. "Thrice great" in Latin was "Ter maximus." I combined the two and wrought a small change and the name Turms Termax was born.</p>

    <p>Initially, I conceived of Turms as a "good guy," a staunch defender—and possibly founder—of civilization and an implacable foe of Chaos. That conception started to change after I read Richard L. Tierney&#8217;s Simon of Gitta pulp stories, whose protagonist was the infamous Simon Magus of Christian lore. Slowly, the idea of making Turms a Simon Magus figure, a Gnostic-style magician who opposed the established religion and preached apotheosis for mankind came into my head. I borrowed elements from the life of Gaius Caligula and other Roman emperors who believed themselves living gods, as well as from messianic religious figures. Bit by bit, my notion of Turms changed, until he took on a decidedly sinister cast. I liked the change and it spawned a lot of great ideas, as I created Dwimmermount and refereed my campaign.</p>

    <h2 id="2_sentry_post">2. Sentry Post</h2>

    <p>This chamber was once a guard room. Now, dust and cobwebs fill it. There are the shattered remnants of some wooden chairs and a weapons rack, but the room is otherwise empty.</p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_2">

    <p>The dungeon stocking tables in OD&amp;D imply that around two-thirds of all dungeon rooms contain no monsters and only one-sixth of such rooms contain unguarded treasure. Consequently, most rooms on any given level will be empty. This runs contrary to some players&#8217; expectations and takes some getting used to. Dungeon exploration in OD&amp;D is at least partly an exercise in resource allocation. This includes time. Empty rooms present a question: is it worth the time—a vital resource—to explore this room and see if it has anything worthwhile to find? </p>

    <p>Not every empty room is completely devoid of content. There may be no monsters (or unguarded treasure), but doesn&#8217;t there might not be something of interest or utility within. Such things include discarded bits of gear from previous explorers/inhabitants, items that might prove useful elsewhere in the dungeon, evidence of what the room was used for, or vital clues that may aid the characters later. The empty rooms in Dwimmermount have served all those purposes and more.</p>

    <p>And of course some empty rooms don&#8217;t need anything in them at all. They can still be interesting, however. Characters might use them as temporary strongholds if they decide to spend the night in the dungeon, for example. They can be where the referee places something he comes up with on the fly, as he is inspired through play. They can also be good sources of mystery and/or tension. Precisely because many players expect each room to have some significance, they work very hard at "finding" it, which is to say, coming up with it. Often, their ideas are clever and worth swiping—a referee ought never to be ashamed of borrowing good ideas from any source—and at other times the mere fact that the players have imputed significance that isn&#8217;t there can add to the mounting tension. </p>

    <p>More than once, players in my original campaign became convinced that an empty room containing bits of broken furniture or rusted metal was a site of some importance or danger. Perhaps I am cruel referee, but I enjoyed watching them react in this way. It told me I was doing my job well by setting a tone of mystery. If they were spending time pondering the "meaning" of an empty room, they were enjoying themselves. It might not have been exciting in the way that, say, combat is, but it was fun and that, ultimately, is the only metric by which I judge a dungeon.</p>

    </div>    

    <h2 id="3_receiving_room">3. Receiving Room</h2>

    <p>This large room contains the remains of smashed wooden tables and chairs. Faded frescoes and tattered tapestries cover the walls. It was once a hall for the reception of dignitaries and guests of high rank. Currently, the room is the home for a scouting party of 7 orcs that made their way to this level from level 2A.</p>

    <p>Orc Scouts (6) [AL C, MV 120&#8217; (40&#8217;), AC 6. HD 1, HP 6, 5, 4, 2, 2, 2, #AT 1, DG 1d8, SV F1, ML 10]</p>

    <p>Orc Leader (1) [AL C, MV 120&#8217; (40&#8217;), AC 5, HD 1, HP 8, #AT 1, DG 1d8+1, SV F1, ML 10]</p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_3">

    <p>Orcs are, for many people, the iconic monster for the first level of a dungeon, so I decided to include them on the first level of Dwimmermount too. I also decided I wanted to use the pig-faced orcs of early D&amp;D rather than the more traditional ones of Tolkien. This got me to think about what orcs were and where they came from. I hit upon the idea that they were pig-faced because they were, in fact, boars given humanoid form through dark magic. I liked this idea for a number of reasons, not least of which being that it gave me a way to explain the presence of so many different humanoid species in the setting. I started to conceive of many of them as "beast men," animals given a Man-like shape and cruel intelligence by Chaotic sorcery.</p>

    </div>
    

    <h2 id="4_depository">4. Depository</h2>

    <p>This storeroom chokes with dust. Scattered about are the remains of many wooden crates. A character who enters must make a successful petrification saving throw or stir up enough dust to cause all within to sneeze and cough for 1-4 rounds. Each round earns one roll on the wandering monster table.</p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_4">

    <p>In my experience, wandering monsters are something a lot of referees either forget or outright ignore. I can understand why and I have been as guilty of this as anyone. When I was younger, on the other, I was quite scrupulous about making wandering monster rolls, both because I liked to throw more opponents at my friends&#8217; characters—yeah, I was one of those referees—and because the rules said I was supposed to. Nowadays, I use them because I understand their purpose. Like empty rooms, they&#8217;re a pacing mechanism, reminding players that there are consequences to spending too much time examining every nook and cranny of a room for potential loot. They&#8217;re also unscripted events out of the control of the players and the referee and thus, in my opinion, add surprises to a session.</p>

    <p>I like wandering monsters enough that there are many rooms and features in Dwimmermount that can trigger additional rolls on the wandering monster tables. In most cases, these rolls are only triggered if the characters are foolhardy or impatient. As a rule, I don&#8217;t like tricks or traps that trigger regardless of player action. I prefer to let the players punish themselves.</p>

    </div>
    
    <h2 id="5_hall_of_masks">5. Hall of Masks</h2>

    <p>Five Thulian war masks—demonic face guards worn on helmets to terrify foes—adorn the walls of this circular room. Lying on the floor in front of a missing mask is the skeleton of a Man in battered chain mail armor. The skeleton has nothing else of value. </p>

    <p>The masks are all trapped. Removing one without first deactivating a hidden trigger causes poisonous gas to billow into the room. The gas fills the 5-foot × 5-foot square immediately in front of a mask. The poison has grown weak with age, granting a +2 bonus to saving throws versus poison. Failure indicates death.</p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_5">

    <p>Like empty rooms and wandering monsters, traps are a key part of the risk-reward assessments at the heart of OD&amp;D-style dungeon exploration. So, I knew from the first that I was going to include a lot of traps in Dwimmermount. The problem for me was that I&#8217;ve never been very good at designing traps. My problem is twofold. First, I genuinely have difficulty coming up with "fiendish" ideas for traps. My traps are very straightforward and, to long-time players, old hat. Second, I want traps to spring only as the result of player foolhardiness or haste. I may enjoy seeing the players deal with unexpected problems, but I prefer that those problems be self-inflicted. To do this, I need to make a room containing a trap enticing in some way.</p>

    <p>In the case of this room, I&#8217;m not sure I succeeded. Nearly every party that came to the room either avoided it entirely, since it was clearly trapped or else quickly deemed it wasn&#8217;t worth their while to mess with its contents. I suppose I could have emphasized the value of the war masks more, but that approach feels heavy-handed. Similarly, I could have removed the skeleton and thus the clue that the room was dangerous, but that feels needlessly cruel. In the end, I&#8217;m not sure what I ought to have done differently to "improve" the room. As presented here in its original form, I consider it something of a failure.</p>

    </div>
    

    <h2 id="6_chamber_of_victories">6. Chamber of Victories</h2>

    <p>This large room once contained trophies (plaques, statues, etc.) commemorating Thulian military victories. There are indentations in the walls, shelves, and brackets that all attest to their former presence. Also in the room are the stony corpses of two dwarves. They wear chain mail and carry axes, but the rest of their belongings (if any) are no longer present.</p>


    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_6">

    <p>The description of this room has been altered slightly from its earliest form. There were always the dead bodies of two dwarves here. They were intended as a clue to the fact that a party of dwarves had been in Dwimmermount ahead of the player characters, who believed themselves to be the first adventurers inside the mountain fortress in several hundred years. Originally, those bodies were flesh and blood, just like those of Men. </p>

    <p>Through play, my conception of dwarves changed considerably, thanks in no small part to the way a dwarf character was roleplayed by a good friend of mine. Many of the details about Dwimmermount dwarves, such as their reproductive habits, were created by him in dialog with the other players. I ran with them and eventually hit upon the idea that dwarves revert back to stone when they die. This idea didn&#8217;t occur to me until after the characters had already explored this room (but before they explored Room 34), so the original appearance of fleshy dwarf corpses was never explained. I suspect the players simply forgot about it (fortunately for me). </p>

    <p>As I said, the room description here is in keeping with those later ideas rather than my original ways. I don&#8217;t feel too bad about doing this, since every other time I&#8217;ve run the dungeon for people, the room contained statue-like dwarf bodies. That&#8217;s become the "reality" of Dwimmermount over the years, but you&#8217;re welcome to change it back in your own campaign, if you prefer. Maybe doing so will inspire you to come up with a different take on dwarves.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 id="7_treasury">7. Treasury</h2>

    <p>A locked iron door (the key is in Room 25) bars the way. Behind it is a storehouse of valuable but commonplace trinkets seized by Thulian soldiers as spoils of war. In total, these trinkets are worth 8,000 gp and weigh approximately 500 lbs. Hidden amongst the trinkets are a horn of blasting, a bag of holding, a sword +1, and a treasure map (16,000 gp value).</p>

    <p>Guarding the vault is a wight bound here by lingering but powerful magic that prevents its leaving the room. </p>

    <p>Wight (1) [AL C, MV 90&#8217; (30&#8217;), AC 5, HD 3, HP 14, #AT 1, DG Drain life energy, SV F3, ML 12]</p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_7">

    <p>There is probably no attack more feared in D&amp;D than level drain. I have known players would rather their characters die than lose a level or two to undead with this baleful power. I suspect that&#8217;s part of why I like level drain: it&#8217;s one of the few monster abilities that inspires genuine fear in players as well as their characters. I remember experiencing this terror firsthand when I played The Keep on the Borderlands decades ago and ran into the wight in the crypt. So, when I started the Dwimmermount campaign, I knew I wanted to include level-draining undead in the dungeon too. </p>

    <p>At the same time, I knew I had to fence off the wight in such a way that the characters wouldn&#8217;t run into it purely by accident. That&#8217;s why this room is locked and the enchanted so that the wight cannot leave the room. In my home campaign, the characters learned of the wight&#8217;s existence by knocking on the locked door and getting a blood-curdling howl in return. They didn&#8217;t know that it was a wight as such, but they guessed it was something really nasty and didn&#8217;t make much of an effort to enter the room until they were better prepared to do so. The treasure here is fairly significant, too—the largest hoard on the level—which seems only right, considering the potential danger.</p>

    </div>    

    <h2 id="8_oratory">8. Oratory</h2>

    <p>This room is a chapel dedicated to Turms Termax in his guise as Mavors, god of war. There are six decorative columns in the room. Set into each of the columns is a sconce on which stands an eldritch bones. When someone enters the oratory, these magical constructs spring to life and attack.</p>

    <p>Eldritch Bones (12) [AL N, MV 90&#8217; (30&#8217;), AC 5, HD 1+1, HP 9, 8, 7 (x4), 6 (x3), 5 (x2), 3, #AT 1, DG 1d6+1, SV F1, ML 12]</p>

    <p>Along the southern wall of the room is a despoiled, marble altar. Pushing it aside reveals a secret door. Careful observers notice evidence of the altar&#8217;s mobility on the floor. This increases the chance of finding the secret door by 1. </p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_8">

    <p>I can&#8217;t quite remember how this notion got into my head, but I decided that every level of Dwimmermount would have at least one monster and one magic item of my own creation. I didn&#8217;t stick to this pattern with any consistency, as it turned out, but it was a general principle I&#8217;d initially deemed worthy. I still think it&#8217;s important to include content even the most jaded players will not have seen before; I simply don&#8217;t follow it blindly. In any case, the eldritch bones were created with this in mind. I liked the idea of a monster that looked like it was undead but wasn&#8217;t, just to mess with clerics. I also wanted to lay the groundwork for some of the magical "technology" that existed elsewhere in the dungeon. I wanted to hit home that the Thulians, the Eld, and the Great Ancients before them treated sorcery as a science they understood with precision enough to produce all sorts of oddities.</p>

    </div>
        

    <h2 id="9_sacred_vault">9. Sacred Vault</h2>

    <p>This hidden room was once a treasury for the chapel; some of its hoard still remains. In several bags are 400 sp, 10 gp, 4 gems (obsidian, 10 gp; zircon, 100 gp; tourmaline, 500 gp; onyx, 100 gp), a scarab of death, and the carved stone head of the goddess Tyche.</p>

    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_9">

    <p>I remember reading some Roman history or other—it might have been Suetonius—in which he told of how Gaius Caligula had placed images of his own head and face placed on the statues of the Olympian gods in many temples. Since Caligula was one of several inspirations for Turms Termax (see note 1), I thought it&#8217;d be fun to do something similar to the statuary in Dwimmermount. </p>

    <p>One of the characters in my home campaign was a cleric of Tyche and, at one point, he got the idea of using his funds to have a new head of his goddess crafted to put on top of her statue defiled by the cult of Turms Termax. I thought this a great idea and a terrific act of piety, so, when he did it, I granted him a small boon from his divine patron. I then thought it&#8217;d make sense if the same sort of thing were possible with the statues of other gods. I started adding statuary heads in treasure hoards throughout the dungeon and thought up appropriate blessings to anyone who restored them to their proper place.</p>

    <p>Like a lot of things that happened in my campaign, I was very impressed by the player&#8217;s action. He&#8217;d entered into the world I&#8217;d presented and played his character&#8217;s role well. He was showing respect for his character&#8217;s imaginary deity and I loved that. I&#8217;d like to be able to tell you what I did that elicited this response in my player, but I can&#8217;t. It was one of those spur of the moment inspirations that surprise you when you&#8217;ve got good players—and I had some very good players.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>10.</h2>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_10">

    <p>In creating the original key to Dwimmermount, I somehow overlooked Room 10. I never wrote up a description of its contents and, because the players in my home campaign never explored it, I didn&#8217;t notice the oversight for two years. When I did notice, I was running a session at OSRCon and I had to improvise on the spot. I don&#8217;t recall precisely what I said was in the room—I suspect it was some sort of mysterious detritus—but I vowed I&#8217;d go home and correct the key afterwards. I never did and the same thing happened the next time I ran the dungeon. </p>

    <p>When the time came to prepare my keys for publication, I still didn&#8217;t notice the oversight, which is why the key you&#8217;re reading now has no description. I briefly considered making up a description for this release, but decided against it in the end. I figured it was useful/interesting to show that stuff like this can happen when you&#8217;ve got a huge, sprawling locale like Dwimmermount. There are always going to be things you overlook or forget and that&#8217;s OK. Granted, I&#8217;m a fairly improvisational (i.e. lazy) referee, so I&#8217;m used to winging it when the situation demands. I think that&#8217;s a useful skill for any referee to acquire, so I&#8217;m leaving Room 10 un-described.</p>

    </div>    

    <h2 id="11_statue_of_turms_mavors">11. Statue of Turms-Mavors</h2>

    <p>In this area is the six-foot tall statue of a muscular man in armor, carrying a shield and wielding a spear. Atop his shoulders sits the head of Turms Termax, although body is that of Mavors, god of war.</p>

    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_11">

    <p>Mavors is the Etruscan precursor to the Roman war god Mars. After adopting the name Turms from Etruscan mythology, I frequently borrowed other names from it as well. </p>

    <h2 id="12_dormitory">12. Dormitory</h2>

    <p>This room was once a barracks for Thulian soldiers. Their cots and other furnishings are now splinters. Searching the debris uncovers 300 sp and 40 gp. </p>

    <h2 id="13_larder">13. Larder</h2>

    <p>This small chamber once held dried foodstuffs, but it is now empty, except for dust, cobwebs, and the rotted remains of crates. </p>

    <h2 id="14_cloister">14. Cloister</h2>

    <p>Voices emanate from this room. They speak an archaic form of Low Thulian (Common) and discuss mundane military matters. The speakers are four Thulian soldiers, who take no notice of anyone who enters. The soldiers appear shadowy and completely lacking in substance. Neither physical nor magical means can harm them. They are not undead but the psychic "echoes" of soldiers who died in Dwimmermount. </p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_14">

    <p>On the first level, there are a few places where there are "echoes of the past," which are basically psychic impressions left behind by the previous inhabitants of Dwimmermount. I put them there to be creepy and worry the players, who might assume they were undead. Initially, I toyed with the possibility that there might be more potent echoes that were in fact a type of undead. I changed my mind on that once I decided that I wanted to muddy the waters regarding whether any kind of afterlife awaited those who died. </p>

    <p>I was still very much in the thrall of pulp fantasies at the time and wanted to undermine any assumption that the gods were real and looked after their devotees in death. I wanted there to be some uncertainty on such Big Questions. One way I did this was by eliminating all insubstantial undead (like wraiths and spectres), feeling that their existence hinted at an answer clearer than I wanted. I wasn&#8217;t entirely consistent on this point, but that was my intention.</p>

    <h2 id="15_chamber_of_memories">15. Chamber of Memories</h2>

    <p>This chamber contains six stone pedestals that stand about four feet in height scattered about the room. At the base of each pedestal is a metal plate. Placing at least one foot on a plate activates a magical effect that transmits moving images and sounds into the person&#8217;s mind.</p>

    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_15">

    <p>I had a broad idea of the history of Dwimmermount and its various inhabitants/builders over the millennia. My earliest conception was that it was the stronghold of the Eld, the Red Elves of Areon, who invaded and ensalved Man. The Thulians were imagined as northern barbarians who had remained free from Eldritch control and eventually fomented a revolt against the invaders. Like Alexander&#8217;s armies, they took over the empire of their enemies and slowly assimilated aspects of its culture. I wanted the Thulians to be noble at first but who slowly became corrupted by the magic and technology they inherited from the Eld. This would set the stage for the coup Turms Termax would orchestrate that resulted in his taking over the Thulian Empire.</p>

    <p>The precise details of this history were often vague and I changed my mind a lot. Nevertheless, I wanted Dwimmermount to have a sense of history attached to it and I wanted the characters (and their players) to be aware of events that took place in the past. That&#8217;s why I created this room. In practice, I don&#8217;t think it worked as well as I wanted it to. Much of the history of Dwimmermount was revealed through other means, like sages and tomes of lore, as well as my simply telling the players things I thought their characters might know.</p>

    <p>This empty room contains empty weapons racks, along with the usual dust and cobwebs. Three dwarves lies dead in this room. Their corpses are stony, like those seen elsewhere.</p>

    <h2 id="17_training_room">17. Training Room</h2>

    <p>Thulian soldiers trained in this room. It contains nine mechanical apparatuses that each hold a sword and shield. On the western wall is a control panel with a series of 10 switches. If a character activates one of the switches, roll a die. A roll of 1 through 9 activates apparatuses equal to the result. They move about the room on grooves on the floor, swinging their swords. A result of 10 shuts down any active apparatuses.</p>

    <p>The apparatuses are not intelligent and cannot leave the grooves, which run north to south, with three per row. They have AC 8 and deal 1-6 points of damage per successful hit, striking as 1 HD creatures. While even one apparatus is in operation, the door locks and does not open again, except by magic or picking the lock.</p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_17">

    <p>This was another attempt at a trap that I don&#8217;t think worked very well, though I still like the idea behind it. Since Level 1 is given over to a lot of military matters, it made sense to me that there might be a room for practicing combat. I thought the idea of mechanical training dummies was a good one too. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t implement the idea very well—it was too easy to avoid—and so I consider the room a disappointment. </p>

    <p>This room was once a laboratory of some sort. There is a long, metal-reinforced wooden table here, covered in stains in a variety of colors. Along the walls are many metallic shelves, some of which are also stained. Strewn about the room are shards of glass. There is also evidence of other wooden furniture having once been here, but it is now reduced to rotten splinters. </p>

    <p>This chamber once held a small library of scrolls and codices of a military or historical nature. Now, the metal shelves that line the walls are sparse. The remaining texts are completely valueless and/or crumble to dust if a character touches them. The exceptions are the following:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>An annotated copy of Arto Bellumoi, a text on strategy and tactics. If a fighting man reads it over the course of one week, it grants 500 experience points (usable once).</li>
    <li>An old map of a place called "the exarchate of Theana" that would be worth about 500 gp to an interested buyer.</li>
    <li>A burnt scroll of ward against magic. If read, there is a 50% chance of its removing one spell of the lowest level known from the mind of the caster rather than working as intended.</li>

    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_19">

    <p>The Thulian Empire was meant to evoke the Western Roman Empire and with a similar importance to the civilization that came after its fall. In our world, part of the Roman Empire survived the deposition of the last emperor in Rome. The Byzantine Empire, as we call it in the West, was heir to Roman culture and institutions and lasted for nearly a millennium on its own. When I was in college and grad school, I was very interested in Byzantine history. </p>

    <p>So, as the campaign evolved, I started to conceive of the notion a Byzantine equivalent for the Thulian Empire. This empire, which, in my head I called the Empire of Volmar—the name Volmar being derived from my native Baltimore—was located far to the south, well away from the main campaign area, which was dominated by city-states. The Volmarians considered themselves "true Thulians" and appeared occasionally as NPCs in both Dwimmermount itself (see Level 3A) and outside it. I intended the Volmarians to be slightly sinister in that they had designs on reconquering the campaign area, following the historical model of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, who (briefly) reconquered Rome. </p>

    <p>Nothing ever came of that idea, but there are occasional references in the levels below that allude to it. I mention this all because the "exarchate of Theana" on the map is part of the Empire of Volmar.</p>

    <h2 id="20_cache">20. Cache</h2>

    <p>This room once held crates of supplies. Now, it serves as the lair of 11 kobolds sent to explore the rest of Dwimmermount by the Spawn of Arach-Nacha (see Room 41). Other than the short swords they wield, the kobolds have only 18 cp apiece, some threadbare blankets, and dried rat meat for food.</p>

    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_20">

    <p>I have a fondness for kobolds, precisely because they&#8217;re so weak individually. As a referee, it&#8217;s very satisfying to throw large numbers of them at the characters without (too much) fear that they&#8217;ll overwhelm them. Conversely, players tend to underestimate them, which can lead them to act foolishly when their character are confronted by them. OD&amp;D provides no description of kobolds, but the 1977 Basic Rules edited by Dr J. Eric Holmes, which was the rulebook from which I first learned to play D&amp;D, describes them as "evil dwarf-like creatures." I remembered this description and tied it into the mythology of the dwarves that was evolving through play. I came up with the notion that kobolds were "failed" dwarves, the botched results of dwarven reproduction. I further imagined that they had the ability to transform dead dwarves into more of their own kind, thus explaining the mutual hatred between them and dwarves.</p>

    <h2 id="21_workshop">21. Workshop</h2>

    <p>This room contains a large metal table and lots of metal shelves. Along the south wall are three unusual metal "boxes" festooned with knobs and dials. The boxes are hollow and stand a little over four feet tall. They are warm to the touch. The floor immediately around them is charred and stained with silvery, metallic splotches. Anyone who fiddles with the knobs and dials causes a box to activate with a loud whirring sound that lasts for 1-4 rounds. Roll for wandering monsters each round it is active. An activated box shoots out a jet of steam that deals 1-10 damage to anyone standing immediately in front of the box. A successful saving throw versus dragon breath reduces the damage by half.</p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_21">

    <p>Though it was never surmised in the course of play, the devices in this room were used to manufacture dwarves in ancient times. I imagined that the first dwarves were artificially created by the Great Ancients as servants, a process achieved through magical technology. This was one of many secrets I wanted the characters to uncover in Dwimmermount, so I planted clues like these machines. I thought it a shame that none of the players ever figured this out. I concluded that the hints were too subtle and so tried to be more explicit in the clues found in the deeper levels of the dungeon.</p>

The room is not dusty nor is there much in the way of debris here. The floor of the eastern two-thirds of the room has been coated with a thick layer of oil that is visible if a character gets within 10 feet of it.

    <h2 id="28_the_moon_pool">28. The Moon Pool</h2>

    <p>This unoccupied cave has a small opening in its roof through which moonlight can shine, reflecting in the nearby pool. The pool holds what alchemists call &#8220;true water,&#8221; a liquid untainted by physical contaminants. Nothing can destroy true water or alter its state. Thus, it does not evaporate and even the mightiest spells cannot freeze it. True water is a supernatural solvent, dissolving magical energies within itself.</p>

    <p>In the case of the Moon Pool, the magical energies it dissolves are moon rays, called &#8220;lunar emanations&#8221; by sages. Living beings who partake of the Pool&#8217;s contents can imbibe these rays. The rays boost—or diminish—magical potency, according to the current phase of the moon. Drinking from the Moon Pool has the following effects: </p>

    </table>
    
    <p>A character who drinks from the Moon Pool must make a saving throw against spells. Success indicates that the effect listed above occurs, according to the current phase of the moon. The effect lasts for a number of days equal to 1 plus the difference between the saving throw number and the number rolled. For example, a 6th-level magic-user requires a 12 to save against spells. If his player rolls 14, the appropriate effect lasts for 3 days. Failure provides no effect. Later drinks have no effect for a number of days equal to the amount by which the character failed his saving throw. While one effect is operative, later drinks provide no effect, good or bad. Finally, no known means can dispel the Moon Pool&#8217;s effects. A character who has drunk from its waters must wait until the appropriate number of days has passed before its effects will fade. </p>

    <p>&#8220;+1 caster level&#8221; means that, for spells that have variable effects based on level (e.g. fireball), the caster is treated as one level higher than he is. &#8220;+1 spell&#8221; means the character gains a bonus spell of the type indicated for the duration the Moon Pool&#8217;s infused water is in effect. Effects stated as a penalty (e.g. &#8220;-1 caster level&#8221;) function in reverse.</p>

    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_34">

    <p>As I mentioned above (Room 20), kobolds are "failed" dwarves. I thought I was pretty clever in coming up with this origin. The problem with it was twofold. According to the rules I created for the creation of dwarven "sons," a failed roll wasn&#8217;t very likely. Even if it had been, I also established that, by custom, dwarves were limited to a single attempt at reproducing themselves, regardless of whether the attempt succeeded or not. Sure, some dwarves might buck that custom, but, even so, I had placed a cap on how many failed dwarves there likely to be are out there and it wasn&#8217;t enough to explain why there were so many kobolds.</p>

    <p>I thought about it a bit more and I came up with the notion that kobolds could be created by corrupting the bodies of dead dwarves, restoring them to some twisted semblance of life. This wasn&#8217;t a power kobolds possessed naturally, but something certain demons knew, which is why kobolds often serve demons (or their representatives). I was pleased with this idea, because it provide me with a means to include a demon of some sort on Level 1, something I rarely saw in the other dungeons of my acquaintance.</p>

In the hands of a Chaotic character, the relic deals 1-6 damage that only a Lawful cleric can heal. Neutral characters gain neither bane nor boon from touching the relic, though it does feel cold to the touch.</p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_35">

    <p>I noted earlier (Room 1) that I contemplated having a monotheistic cosmology for the campaign setting. I never completely abandoned this idea—and in fact "cheated," as I&#8217;ll explain later—which is why there often relics of saints and holy men to be found in Dwimmermount. I&#8217;m quite fascinated by such objects and their veneration, so it only seemed right to include them. This particular relic is based on one I&#8217;d created earlier and which appeared in a small dungeon I wrote for the premier issue of the Fight On! fanzine (Spring 2008). That dungeon was one of the very first things I wrote after coming back to the D&amp;D of my youth.</p>

    <p>Thulian soldiers used this cave as a secret shrine to Tyche. The shrine consists of a roughly-hewn bas relief of the goddess, her hands outstretched with the palms upward. In her palms are 82 gold coins, some of them quite old. If anyone adds another gold piece to the collection, they gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws for the next 24 hours. A character can receive this blessing only once. The statue shocks anyone taking even a single coin for 2-12 damage (save against spells for half damage). The shrine radiates magic and its trap resets after activation. The kobolds avoid this shrine out of fear.</p>

    <h2 id="37_azoth_spring">37. Azoth Spring</h2>

    <p>In the southwestern part of this cave, a silvery-black liquid bubbles up from a tiny spring in the floor. There is a small pool of this liquid, surrounded by a hardened layer of the stuff. The liquid is the magical metal called azoth. Even a small vial of it can fetch between 50 and 100 gp to alchemists and magic-users. The azoth is neither beneficial nor poisonous if consumed in small quantities. It tastes awful and is difficult to swallow.</p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_37">

    <p>When I began creating Dwimmermount, I had no real "master plan" as to its contents, so I simply threw together everything I found interesting and hoped some of it might stick. One such thing was alchemical concepts and equipment. Azoth is an old-fashioned word for mercury, which was sometimes believed to be a universal solvent and an important component in creating the Elixir of Life. I found that intriguing and so started to suggest that Dwimmermount was a natural source of azoth, which might explain why it played such a major role in the histories of several empires. </p>

    <p>Through play, I started adding details about azoth and its properties, suggesting that some of these details might not be true. I wanted to give myself some room to maneuver, in case I came up with better ideas later. Plus, misinformation is a good way to motivate players. The earliest details that emerged were that azoth was the key to immortality. In this way, it became associated strongly with the story of Turms Termax, who was supposedly the first Man to achieve this goal and whose cult was dedicated to re-discovering the means by which he achieved it. This in turn tied into lore the characters found that suggested the gods were a lie and that there was only oblivion after death. </p>

    <p>As happened many times over the course of the campaign, I was mostly making it all up as I went along, drawing on a lifetime&#8217;s worth of facts and ideas, mixed together with utter nonsense. I have a pretty extensive knowledge of fringe science, Fortean phenomena, and esoteric beliefs. It was very easy for me to look to them for inspirations when no other ideas occurred to me. I developed the ideas that caught the players&#8217; interests and looked for ways to tie those ideas into things I&#8217;d already established. This approach worked remarkably well, often giving the illusion that I knew what I was doing from the beginning, but I really didn&#8217;t. I cannot stress that enough.</p>

I decided against that, because, as much as I wanted to evoke CAS, I didn&#8217;t want to feel bound by his portrayal of the creature. So, I modified the name to Arach-Nacha as a play on "arachnid." In any case, Arach-Nacha played only a very minor role in my campaign and was largely forgotten after the early stages of play, so I never develop him or his cult to any great degree.</p>

    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_46">

    <p>One of my intentions in creating Dwimmermount was to provide a vehicle for me to approach OD&amp;D without any preconceptions. Since I&#8217;d been playing D&amp;D in some form or another since 1979, this wasn&#8217;t always easy. To combat a lifetime of personal expectations and interpretations, I decided to play the game "straight," which is to say, without modifying the rules as they were presented. One way this played out was that I used random rolls a great deal, especially for things like the number of monsters present, their hit points—and the treasure they guarded.</p>

    <p>According to the standard treasure tables, giant rats have a pretty good chance to have up to 12,000 copper pieces in their possession. They also have a similar chance to have up to four pieces of gems and jewelry. When I rolled up their treasure, they wound up with only 2000 copper pieces, as well as three pieces of jewelry.  Trying to figure out why these giant rats had accumulated such a large number of copper pieces was an occasion to exercise my creativity. Rather than dismiss their presence or to substitute a more "logical" result, I instead thought of explanations. </p>

    <p>In my home campaign, the players&#8217; characters never found this room. However, they did free the cat prince (Level 2A: Room 60) and, from him, learned of the existence of the King of Cats. That idea suggested to me that there might be other "beast lords" (to borrow a term from Moorcock). That&#8217;s when I remembered the giant rats and copper pieces and an idea started to take shape. What if the giant rats had accumulated the treasure as part of their tribute to a Rat King at war with the Cat King? There were rat kings in medieval folkore, after all, as well as a Mouse King in The Nutcracker, so the idea wasn&#8217;t without precedent. I let it simmer in the back of my mind until I needed it, as I&#8217;ll explain in more detail in the commentary to Level 2A.</p>

    <p>As a referee, I find it very easy to keep going back to same well for ideas. That&#8217;s why I like random tables: they force me to grapple with results I would never come up with on my own. Had it not been for the 2000 copper pieces, the spark of some important aspects of my ongoing campaign would never have come to be. It wasn&#8217;t the only spark, but it played a role. That&#8217;s one of the lessons I learned early on: you never know what might inspire you. Going into dungeon creation with a "plan" or "vision" beforehand might appear to lead to a more "coherent" locale. In my experience, though, it made things more predictable and bland. I ended up abandoning many of my initial ideas after better ones emerged through the interaction of randomness, the players&#8217; response to it, and my own ideas.</p>

    <h2 id="47_map_room">47. Map Room</h2>

    <p>This circular room contains mosaics on the floors, walls, and ceiling. The mosaics depict the Thulian Empire at its height, with emphasis given to forts and other military locales. The floor mosaic shows Dwimmermount&#8217;s location at its center. The room is currently occupied by 6 orcs, who came from Level 2A to explore. In their possession is a large sack containing 2000 gp and the some gems: two rhodochrosite (50 gp each), rock crystal (100 gp), sardonyx (75 gp), and a star rose quartz (100gp).</p>

    <h2 id="48_meeting_room">48. Meeting Room</h2>

    <p>A large hardwood table is still present in this room. Any chairs that once accompanied it are long since reduced to splinters. There are the remains of tapestries hanging on the walls; what the tapestries depicted is unclear.</p>

    <h2 id="49_commandant8217s_quarters">49. Commandant&#8217;s Quarters</h2>

    <p>This large room holds a heavy wooden desk, along with some smaller tables, chairs, and shelves. All these furnishings are intact. Likewise, there is no layer of dust or cobwebs here. Except for the fact that the desk and shelves are bereft of any contents, the room looks as if it has not changed in centuries. Detect magic reveals a weird but powerful magical radiation in this room.</p>

    <p>Characters who are here for more a few minutes may notice that time does not pass within its walls. Torches stay lit but do not grow shorter, for example. Spell durations are also suspended while in the room, only resuming after the characters leave. The same holds true for diseases and deleterious effects. </p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_49">

    <p>I like unexplained—indeed unexplainable—events and effects. The temporal stasis effect in this room is something I simply thought would pique players&#8217; imaginations. I had no idea why it was operating when I keyed this room and still don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not really sure it matters, though if my players had taken a keen interest in it or started to theorize as to its origins, I might have given it some further thought. That&#8217;s the way I do a lot of things as a referee: I come up with some vaguely defined notion and let the players loose on it. If it grabs their attention and they want to know more, I run with it; if they don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t bother.</p>

    <h2 id="50_secret_room">50. Secret Room</h2>

    <p>An illusion of a demonic humanoid, dressed in black armor and wielding a flaming blade, &#8220;protects&#8221; this room. A single successful hit against AC 9 dispels the illusion. The "demon," which fights as a 4 HD creature, deals real damage (1-8 per hit) to any target it strikes who fails a saving throw versus spells. </p>

    <h2 id="51_hidden_treasure_room">51. Hidden Treasure Room</h2>

    <p>This room contains the following unprotected treasure: 600 sp, hematite (10 gp), rock crystal (100 gp), azurite (25 gp), jasper (250gp), and a rod of opening.</p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_51">

    <p>The hoard here contains this level&#8217;s new magic item: the rod of opening. I created it because there are a number of locked doors on this level and, at the time I created it, I didn&#8217;t allow the thief class in the game. Consequently, I wanted to be sure there was some other means by which the characters might be able to open locked doors whose keys they didn&#8217;t find. As it turned out, I changed my mind regarding the thief before the characters ever found this room or the rod of opening.</p>

    <h2 id="52_dining_area">52. Dining Area</h2>

    <p>This room contains a long, metal-reinforced table and the shattered remains of many chairs. There is nothing else of value in this room.</p>

    <h2 id="53_kitchen">53. Kitchen</h2>

    <p>This room was once used as a kitchen for preparing simple meals. Metal-reinforced wooden tables and counters are here, along with empty crates and tattered sacks. There are 7 fire beetles in this room.</p>

    <p>Fire beetles (7) [AL N, MV 120&#8217; (40&#8217;), AC 4, HD 1+2, hp 10, 9 (x2), 8 (x2), 7, 5, #AT 1, D 2d4, SV F1, ML 7].  </p>

    <h2 id="54_enclosure">54. Enclosure</h2>

    <p>This open area contains six bubbles of some silvery-black material floating in the room. Characters may notice that there is a small crack on the southwest floor from which a silvery-black liquid erupts. Sometimes, the liquid forms little bubbles that pop with a loud noise, leaving behind a metallic tang in the air and a cloud of smoke. These six bubbles consist of the same material and may pop if anyone touches or comes near them. Any character coming within 5 feet of a bubble must make a saving throw versus wands. Failure causes the bubble to pop, dealing 1-6 damage to everyone in a 5-foot radius. There is a 2 in 6 chance that the popping of a bubble will set off another one. Keep rolling until either there is a result of 3 or higher or all six bubbles pop.</p>

    <p>Due to its loudness, each pop results in an immediate check for wandering monsters. If multiple bubbles pop, each pop merits a separate roll. No more than a single group of wandering monsters may appear per 10-minute turn.</p>

    <h2 id="55_lavatory">55. Lavatory</h2>

    <p>This large chamber served as a latrine for the inhabitants of this level. Waste funnels down through pipes into lower levels of the fortress. These pipes are too narrow for any but tiny creatures to traverse. Other than toilets, there is nothing else in this room.</p>

    <h2 id="56_elevator">56. Elevator</h2>

    <p>The doors to this large circular room are magically sealed, requiring the use of either a rod of opening or a knock spell to open. Beyond the doors is an elevator that leads either up to Level 0 (The Divinitarium) or down to Level 4 (The Halls of Lesser Secrets). However, before use, the elevator must have power, which can only be provided by restoring it via the machines in Room 14 of Level 4.</p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_56">

    <p>When I started creating Dwimmermount, I was concerned about the how tedious it might for the characters to have to work their way down through many levels every time they returned to the dungeon after leaving it to re-supply. That&#8217;s when the notion of an elevator came to me. I liked it not only for the ease with which the characters could potentially reach a lower level, but also for the "high tech" quality it lent to the place. I wanted to hit home that Dwimmermount was the product of an earlier age, when magic functioned as technology and something like an elevator seemed a simple but effective way to do that.</p>

    <p>In play, the elevator only ever led to Level 4. What is now known as Level 0 never had a formal location in the dungeon. I&#8217;d come up with the idea of the place and wanted to put it somewhere, but never got around to doing so. When I gave some thought to it, the most logical location was above Level 1. It was then that I decided to make the elevator go up as well as down. </p>

    <h2 id="58_pumping_station">58. Pumping Station</h2>

    <p>This chamber contains a mass of metal pipes and machinery, as well as a variety of spigots and basins. They are still operational, though disuse has made the valves hard to turn. The water that flows from the spigots is discolored (though still potable). </p>

    <h2 id="59_recreation_area">59. Recreation Area</h2>

    <p>This room is empty of any real furnishings or inhabitants. There is a spectral table and benches in its center. The apparitions of four Thulian soldiers sit there playing zatrikio, a game beloved by both officers and common soldiers. The apparitions take no notice of anyone who enters the room. They continue to play their game regardless of what transpires around them.</p>

    <h2 id="60_lounge">60. Lounge</h2>

    <p>Besides an assortment of splintered furnishings and random detritus, this dusty chamber is empty.</p>

    <h2 id="61_waiting_room">61. Waiting Room</h2>

    <p>This room once contained wooden furniture, now shattered fragments. In the center of the room, there is a 4-foot tall pillar made of black basalt. Inscribed on the pillar are runes whose meaning is unknown even to magic-users and other students of arcane lore. The pillar radiates an enchantment under detect magic. Any non-Man (such as a dwarf, elf, or goblin) who touches the pillar must make a saving throw versus spells or become docile for 1-6 turns. While in this state, they will not attack another creature even to defend themselves. At the referee&#8217;s discretion, remove curse or similar spells can remove this effect sooner.</p>

    <h2 id="62_audience_chamber">62. Audience Chamber</h2>

    <p>There is a small dais on the southern part of this room, on which rests a fragile wooden throne. Rotting tapestries decorated with the symbolic spear of Mavors cover the walls. Also on the walls are several rusty (and useless) shields. </p>

    <h2 id="63_guard_post">63. Guard Post</h2>

    <p>Empty weapons racks and shattered furniture abound in this room. 6 orcs are present. They have 1000 gp between them.</p>

    <h2 id="64_chamber_of_the_face">64. Chamber of the Face</h2>

    <p>This large room once contained several rows of wooden benches bolted to the floor. Some of them are now gone but two remain and are in good condition. On the northern wall of the room is a sculpture of a bearded Man&#8217;s face made from rusty metal. If anyone comes within 5 feet of the face, its mouth begins to move slightly and unintelligible sounds emanate from it. Should anyone apply oil or some other lubricant to the corners of the face&#8217;s mouth, it opens more widely and speaks clearly. It says, in ancient Thulian, "Ask a question but only one, I&#8217;ll answer truthfully and then am done." If the question is in ancient Thulian, he face will answer truthfully to the best of its knowledge. It knows only about this level and its information is out of date, so the referee should bear this in mind when crafting a reply. If a character asks about something the face does not know, it will say so, but such a question counts toward the one it will answer. If asked any more questions after the first, it will reply, again in ancient Thulian, "Go away, I shall not answer again today." A character can ask again in 24 hours.</p>

    <p>This room is a straight-up lift from Room I in the sample dungeon included in the 1977 Basic Rules edited by J. Eric Holmes.

    <h2 id="68_magician8217s_quarters">68. Magician&#8217;s Quarters</h2>

    <p>This room was once used a Termaxian magic-user, as shown by the arcane symbols on the smashed mosaics that cover its walls. There are metal shelves on some of the walls as well, along with metal cabinets. The room now holds 4 orcs, who are interrogating a gnome named Balfar.</p>

    <p>Orcs (4) [AL C, MV 120&#8217; (40&#8217;), AC 6, HD 1, hp 8, 6, 4 (x2), #AT 1, D 1d6, SV F1, ML 8].</p>

    <p>Balfar can cast the spell wall of vapor (see page XX), but he no longer has it memorized. He entered Dwimmermount a few days ago with a party of dwarves. They were following rumors that there might be a dwarf cemetery within the mountain fortress. He and his companions never found the cemetery but were instead ambushed by orcs. He is, so far as he knows, the sole survivor of his party. He will pay 500 gp if anyone helps him escape this place. </p>
    
    <div class="commentary" id="commentary_68">

    <p>As I pondered the wider world beyond Dwimmermount, I found myself in a quandary. I liked most of the monsters and races of classical D&amp;D, but I nevertheless felt there were too many of them. Including them all without some sense of how they fit into the larger cosmology was a non-starter for me. Even if the players and their characters never knew any of this stuff, I wanted to know it. I felt it was important to being able to present a believable fantasy world. That&#8217;s how I came up with the idea of beast men (see Room 3), for example.</p>

    <p>In a similar vein, I wanted to include gnomes. I liked the traditional portrayal of gnomes in D&amp;D as smaller, magical dwarves, but it never made sense to me that they were a separate race. So, I decided to make them "mutant" dwarves, a rare good result of dwarven reproduction gone awry. I thought that better grounded gnomes in the overall setting, as well as providing yet more depth to the weird way dwarves reproduced. Moreover, the idea of gnomes being an offshoot of dwarves is mentioned parenthetically in Supplement I to OD&amp;D, so I figured I was on solid ground.</p>
