1. I've always been fascinated by religion, both real and imagined. Consequently, when I started thinking about the Dwimmermount campaign, my thoughts quickly turned to that subject. I briefly toyed with the idea of bucking the assumption that fantasy is polytheistic and presenting a monotheistic world instead. In retrospect, I often wish I had gone this route, but, at the time, I was drinking deeply from pulp fantasy literature, particularly Clark Ashton Smith, where polytheism is the norm. So, I set about creating my own pantheon for use in the campaign.}

Looking back on the early history of roleplaying, I noticed that many campaigns used a mishmash of deities swiped from historical religions. I decided I'd follow suit and cracked open my copy of }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Gods, Demigods & Heroes }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
to look for suitable gods. One of the first ones I chose was Thoth, the Egyptian deity of knowledge and writing. Even though I was purposefully choosing real world divinities for my setting, I nevertheless wanted to disguise their origins, at least somewhat. I did a little research into Thoth and was reminded that the Greeks equated him with Hermes. }

One of Thoth's titles was \u8220\'1cthrice great.\u8221\'1d This title, translated into Greek and transliterated into Latin, became \u8220\'1cTrismegistus.\u8221\'1d Hermes Trismegistus played an important role in many esoteric religions and was associated with magic and alchemy. He was also a major figure in Renaissance and later Hermeticism (which derives its name from him). These connections intrigued me and I thought they'd be useful in establishing some mysteries about Dwimmermount and the larger setting. After some more research, I discovered that the Etruscans called Hermes Turms. \u8220\'1cThrice great\u8221\'1d in Latin was \u8220\'1cTer maximus.\u8221\'1d I combined the two and wrought a small change and the name Turms Termax was born.}

Initially, I conceived of Turms as a \u8220\'1cgood guy,\u8221\'1d a staunch defender\u8212\'14and possibly founder\u8212\'14of civilization and an implacable foe of Chaos. That conception started to change after I read Richard L. Tierney's Simon of Gitta pulp stories, whose protagonist was the infamous Simon Magus of Christian lore. Slowly, the idea of making Turms a Simon Magus figure, a Gnostic-style magician who opposed the established religion and preached apotheosis for mankind came into my head. I borrowed elements from the life of Gaius Caligula and other Roman emperors who believed themselves living gods, as well as from messianic religious figures. Bit by bit, my notion of Turms changed, until he took on a decidedly sinister cast. I liked the change and it spawned a lot of great ideas, as I created Dwimmermount and refereed my campaign.}

2. The dungeon stocking tables in OD&D imply that around two-thirds of all dungeon rooms contain no monsters and only one-sixth of such rooms contain unguarded treasure. Consequently, most rooms on any given level will be empty. This runs contrary to some players' expectations and takes some getting used to. Dungeon exploration in OD&D is at least partly an exercise in resource allocation. This includes time. Empty rooms present a question: is it worth the time\u8212\'14a vital resource\u8212\'14to explore this room and see if it has anything worthwhile to find? }

Not every empty room is completely devoid of content. There may be no monsters (or unguarded treasure), but doesn't there might not be something of interest or utility within. Such things include discarded bits of gear from previous explorers/inhabitants, items that might prove useful elsewhere in the dungeon, evidence of what the room was used for, or vital clues that may aid the characters later. The empty rooms in Dwimmermount have served all those purposes and more.}

And of course some empty rooms don't need anything in them at all. They can still be interesting, however. Characters might use them as temporary strongholds if they decide to spend the night in the dungeon, for example. They can be where the referee places something he comes up with on the fly, as he is inspired through play. They can also be good sources of mystery and/or tension. Precisely because many players expect each room to have some significance, they work very hard at \u8220\'1cfinding\u8221\'1d it, which is to say, coming up with it. Often, their ideas are clever and worth swiping\u8212\'14a referee ought never to be ashamed of borrowing good ideas from any source\u8212\'14and at other times the mere fact that the players have imputed significance that isn't there can add to the mounting tension. }

More than once, players in my original campaign became convinced that an empty room containing bits of broken furniture or rusted metal was a site of some importance or danger. Perhaps I am cruel referee, but I enjoyed watching them react in this way. It told me I was doing my job well by setting a tone of mystery. If they were spending time pondering the \u8220\'1cmeaning\u8221\'1d of an empty room, they were enjoying themselves. It might not have been exciting in the way that, say, combat is, but it was fun and that, ultimately, is the only metric by which I judge a dungeon.}

3. Orcs are, for many people, the iconic monster for the first level of a dungeon, so I decided to include them on the first level of Dwimmermount too. I also decided I wanted to use the pig-faced orcs of early D&D rather than the more traditional ones of Tolkien. This got me to think about what orcs were and where they came from. I hit upon the idea that they were pig-faced because they were, in fact, boars given humanoid form through dark magic. I liked this idea for a number of reasons, not least of which being that it gave me a way to explain the presence of so many different humanoid species in the setting. I started to conceive of many of them as \u8220\'1cbeast men,\u8221\'1d animals given a Man-like shape and cruel intelligence by Chaotic sorcery.}

4. In my experience, wandering monsters are something a lot of referees either forget or outright ignore. I can understand why and I }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
have been}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
 as guilty of this as anyone. When I was younger, }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
on the other,}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
 I was quite scrupulous about making wandering monster rolls, both because I liked to throw more opponents at my friends' characters}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
\u8212\'14yeah, I was one of those referees\u8212\'14and because the rules said I was supposed to. Nowadays, I use them because I understand their purpose. Like empty rooms, they're a pacing mechanism, reminding players that there are consequences to spending too much time examining every nook and cranny of a room for potential loot. They're also unscripted events out of the control of the players and the referee and thus, in my opinion, add surprises to a session.}

I like wandering monsters enough that there are many rooms and features in Dwimmermount that can trigger additional rolls on the wandering monster tables. In most cases, these rolls are only triggered if the characters are foolhardy or impatient. As a rule, I don't like tricks or traps that trigger regardless of player action. I prefer to let the players punish themselves.}

5. }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Like empty rooms and wandering monsters, traps are a key part of the risk-reward assessments at the heart of OD&D-style dungeon exploration. So, I knew from the first that I was going to include a lot of traps in Dwimmermount. The problem for me was that I've never been very good at designing traps. My problem is twofold. First, I genuinely have difficulty coming up with \u8220\'1cfiendish\u8221\'1d ideas for traps. My traps are very straightforward and, to long-time players, old hat. Second, I want traps to spring only as the result of player foolhardiness or haste. I may enjoy seeing the players deal with unexpected problems, but I prefer that those problems be self-inflicted. To do this, I need to make a room containing a trap enticing in some way.}

In the case of this room, I'm not sure I succeeded. Nearly every party that came to the room either avoided it entirely, since it was clearly trapped or else quickly deemed it wasn't worth their while to mess with its contents. I suppose I could have emphasized the value of the war masks more, but that approach feels heavy-handed. Similarly, I could have removed the skeleton and thus the clue that the room was dangerous, but that feels needlessly cruel. In the end, I'm not sure what I ought to have done differently to \u8220\'1cimprove\u8221\'1d the room. As presented here in its original form, I consider it something of a failure.}

6. The description of this room has been altered slightly from its earliest form. There were always the dead bodies of two dwarves here. They were intended as a clue to the fact that a party of dwarves had been in Dwimmermount ahead of the player characters, who believed themselves to be the first adventurers inside the mountain fortress in several hundred years. Originally, those bodies were flesh and blood, just like those of Men. }

Through play, my conception of dwarves changed considerably, thanks in no small part to the way a dwarf character was roleplayed by a good friend of mine. Many of the details about Dwimmermount dwarves, such as their reproductive habits, were created by him in dialog with the other players. I ran with them and eventually hit upon the idea that dwarves revert back to stone when they die. This idea didn't occur to me until after the characters had already explored this room (but before they explored Room 34), so the original appearance of fleshy dwarf corpses was never explained. I suspect the players simply forgot about it (fortunately for me). }

As I said, the room description here is in keeping with those later ideas rather than my original ways. I don't feel too bad about doing this, since every other time I've run the dungeon for people, the room contained statue-like dwarf bodies. That's become the \u8220\'1creality\u8221\'1d of Dwimmermount over the years, but you're welcome to change it back in your own campaign, if you prefer. Maybe doing so will inspire you to come up with a different take on dwarves.}

7. There is probably no attack more feared in D&D than level drain. I have known players would rather their characters die than lose a level or two to undead with this baleful power. I suspect that's part of why I like level drain: it's one of the few monster abilities that inspires genuine fear in players as well as their characters. I remember experiencing this terror firsthand when I played }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
The Keep on the Borderlands }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
decades ago and ran into the wight in the crypt. So, when I started the Dwimmermount campaign, I knew I wanted to include level-draining undead in the dungeon too. }

At the same time, I knew I had to fence off the wight in such a way that the characters wouldn't run into it purely by accident. That's why this room is locked and the enchanted so that the wight cannot leave the room. In my home campaign, the characters learned of the wight's existence by knocking on the locked door and getting a blood-curdling howl in return. They didn't know that it was a wight as such, but they guessed it was something really nasty and didn't make much of an effort to enter the room until they were better prepared to do so.

8. I can't quite remember how this notion got into my head, but I decided that every level of Dwimmermount would have at least one monster and one magic item of my own creation.

I also wanted to lay the groundwork for some of the magical \u8220\'1ctechnology\u8221\'1d that existed elsewhere in the dungeon. I wanted to hit home that the Thulians, the Eld, and the Great Ancients before them treated sorcery as a science they understood with precision enough to produce all sorts of oddities.}

9. I remember reading some Roman history or other\u8212\'14it might have been Suetonius\u8212\'14in which he told of how Gaius Caligula had placed images of his own head and face placed on the statues of the Olympian gods in many temples.

One of the characters in my home campaign was a cleric of Tyche and, at one point, he got the idea of using his funds to have a new head of his goddess crafted to put on top of her statue defiled by the cult of Turms Termax. I thought this a great idea and a terrific act of piety, so, when he did it, I granted him a small boon from his divine patron. I then thought it'd make sense if the same sort of thing were possible with the statues of other gods. I started adding statuary heads in treasure hoards throughout the dungeon and thought up appropriate blessings to anyone who restored them to their proper place.}

10. In creating the original key to Dwimmermount, I somehow overlooked Room 10. I never wrote up a description of its contents and, because the players in my home campaign never explored it, I didn't notice the oversight for two years.

When the time came to prepare my keys for publication, I still didn't notice the oversight, which is why the key you're reading now has no description. I briefly considered making up a description for this release, but decided against it in the end. I figured it was useful/interesting to show that stuff like this can happen when you've got a huge, sprawling locale like Dwimmermount. There are always going to be things you overlook or forget and that's OK. Granted, I'm a fairly improvisational (i.e. lazy) referee, so I'm used to winging it when the situation demands. I think that's a useful skill for any referee to acquire, so I'm leaving Room 10 un-described.}

14. On the first level, there are a few places where there are \u8220\'1cechoes of the past,\u8221\'1d which are basically psychic impressions left behind by the previous inhabitants of Dwimmermount. I put them there to be creepy and worry the players, who might assume they were undead. Initially, I toyed with the possibility that there might be more potent echoes that were in fact a type of undead. I changed my mind on that once I decided that I wanted to muddy the waters regarding whether any kind of afterlife awaited those who died. }

I was still very much in the thrall of pulp fantasies at the time and wanted to undermine any assumption that the gods were real and looked after their devotees in death. I wanted there to be some uncertainty on such Big Questions. One way I did this was by eliminating all insubstantial undead (like wraiths and spectres), feeling that their existence hinted at an answer clearer than I wanted.

15. I had a broad idea of the history of Dwimmermount and its various inhabitants/builders over the millennia. My earliest conception was that it was the stronghold of the Eld, the Red Elves of Areon, who invaded and ensalved Man. The Thulians were imagined as northern barbarians who had remained free from Eldritch control and eventually fomented a revolt against the invaders. Like Alexander's armies, they took over the empire of their enemies and slowly assimilated aspects of its culture. I wanted the Thulians to be noble at first but who slowly became corrupted by the magic and technology they inherited from the Eld. This would set the stage for the coup Turms Termax would orchestrate that resulted in his taking over the Thulian Empire.}

The precise details of this history were often vague and I changed my mind a lot. Nevertheless, I wanted Dwimmermount to have a sense of history attached to it and I wanted the characters (and their players) to be aware of events that took place in the past. That's why I created this room. In practice, I don't think it worked as well as I wanted it to. Much of the history of Dwimmermount was revealed through other means, like sages and tomes of lore, as well as my simply telling the players things I thought their characters might know.}

17. This was another attempt at a trap that I don't think worked very well, though I still like the idea behind it. Since Level 1 is given over to a lot of military matters, it made sense to me that there might be a room for practicing combat. I thought the idea of mechanical training dummies was a good one too.

19. The Thulian Empire was meant to evoke the Western Roman Empire and with a similar importance to the civilization that came after its fall. In }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
our world, part of the Roman Empire survived the deposition of the last emperor in Rome. The Byzantine Empire, as we call it in the West, was heir to Roman culture and institutions and lasted for nearly a millennium on its own. When I was in college and grad school, I was very interested in Byzantine history. }

So, as the campaign evolved, I started to conceive of the notion a Byzantine equivalent for the Thulian Empire. This empire, which, in my head I called the Empire of Volmar\u8212\'14the name Volmar being derived from my native Baltimore\u8212\'14was located far to the south, well away from the main campaign area, which was dominated by city-states. The Volmarians considered themselves \u8220\'1ctrue Thulians\u8221\'1d and appeared occasionally as NPCs in both Dwimmermount itself (see Level 3A) and outside it. I intended the Volmarians to be slightly sinister in that they had designs on reconquering the campaign area, following the historical model of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, who (briefly) reconquered Rome. }

20. I have a fondness for kobolds, precisely because they're so weak individually. As a referee, it's very satisfying to throw large numbers of them at the characters without (too much) fear that they'll overwhelm them. Conversely, players tend to underestimate them, which can lead them to act foolishly when their character are confronted by them. OD&D provides no description of kobolds, but the 1977 Basic Rules edited by Dr J. Eric Holmes, which was the rulebook from which I first learned to play D&D, describes them as \u8220\'1cevil dwarf-like creatures.\u8221\'1d I remembered this description and }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
tied it into the mythology of the dwarves that was evolving through play. I came up with the notion that kobolds were \u8220\'1cfailed\u8221\'1d dwarves, the botched results of dwarven reproduction. I further imagined that they had the ability to transform dead dwarves into more of their own kind, thus explaining the mutual hatred between them and dwarves.}

21. Though it was never surmised in the course of play, the devices in this room were used to manufacture dwarves in ancient times. I imagined that the first dwarves were artificially created by the Great Ancients as servants, a process achieved through magical technology. This was one of many secrets I wanted the characters to uncover in Dwimmermount, so I planted clues like these machines. I thought it a shame that none of the players ever figured this out. I concluded that the hints were too subtle and so tried to be more explicit in the clues found in the deeper levels of the dungeon.}

34. As I mentioned above (Room 20), kobolds are \u8220\'1cfailed\u8221\'1d dwarves. I thought I was pretty clever in coming up with this origin. The problem with it was twofold. According to the rules I created for the creation of dwarven \u8220\'1csons,\u8221\'1d a failed roll wasn't very likely. Even if it had been, I also established that, by custom, dwarves were limited to a single attempt at reproducing themselves, regardless of whether the attempt succeeded or not. Sure, some dwarves might buck that custom, but, even so, I had placed a cap on how many failed dwarves there likely to be are out there and it wasn't enough to explain why there were so many kobolds.}

I thought about it a bit more and I came up with the notion that kobolds could be created by corrupting the bodies of dead dwarves, restoring them to some twisted semblance of life. This wasn't a power kobolds possessed naturally, but something certain demons knew, which is why kobolds often serve demons (or their representatives). }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch

37. When I began creating Dwimmermount, I had no real \u8220\'1cmaster plan\u8221\'1d as to its contents, so I simply threw together everything I found interesting and hoped some of it might stick. One such thing was alchemical concepts and equipment. Azoth is an old-fashioned word for mercury, which was sometimes believed to be a universal solvent and an important component in creating the Elixir of Life. I found that intriguing and so started to suggest that Dwimmermount was a natural source of azoth, which might explain why it played such a major role in the histories of several empires. }

Through play, I started adding details about azoth and its properties, suggesting that some of these details might not be true.

The earliest details that emerged were that azoth was the key to immortality. In this way, it became associated strongly with the story of Turms Termax, who was supposedly the first Man to achieve this goal and whose cult was dedicated to re-discovering the means by which he achieved it. This in turn tied into lore the characters found that suggested the gods were a lie and that there was only oblivion after death. }

As happened many times over the course of the campaign, I was mostly making it all up as I went along, drawing on a lifetime's worth of facts and ideas, mixed together with utter nonsense. I have a pretty extensive knowledge of fringe science, Fortean phenomena, and esoteric beliefs. It was very easy for me to look to them for inspirations when no other ideas occurred to me. I developed the ideas that caught the players' interests and looked for ways to tie those ideas into things I'd already established. This approach worked remarkably well, often giving the illusion that I knew what I was doing from the beginning, but I really didn't. I cannot stress that enough.}

The idea just seemed right on several levels. I also suspect I was subconsciously influenced by Obmi, a villainous dwarf who played a big role in Gary Gygax's Greyhawk campaign.}

41. Clark Ashton Smith is my favorite of the holy trinity of Weird Tales pulp writers. Originally, I was coming to use Smith Atlach-Nacha as the name of the Spawn's master. I decided against that, because, as much as I wanted to evoke CAS, I didn't want to feel bound by his portrayal of the creature. So, I modified the name to Arach-Nacha as a play on \u8220\'1carachnid.\u8221\'1d In any case, Arach-Nacha played only a very minor role in my campaign and was largely forgotten after the early stages of play, so I never develop him or his cult to any great degree.}

46. One of my intentions in creating Dwimmermount was to provide a vehicle for me to approach OD&D without any preconceptions. Since I'd been playing }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
D&D }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
in some form or another since 1979, this wasn't always easy. To combat a lifetime of personal expectations and interpretations, I decided to play the game \u8220\'1cstraight,\u8221\'1d which is to say, without modifying the rules as they were presented. One way this played out was that I used random rolls a great deal, especially for things like the number of monsters present, their hit points\u8212\'14and the treasure they guarded.}

According to the standard treasure tables, giant rats have a pretty good chance to have up to 12,000 copper pieces in their possession. They also have a similar chance to have up to four pieces of gems and jewelry.

In my home campaign, the players' characters never found this room. However, they did free the cat prince (Level 2A: Room 60) and, from him, learned of the existence of the King of Cats. That idea suggested to me that there might be other \u8220\'1cbeast lords\u8221\'1d (to borrow a term from Moorcock). That's when I remembered the giant rats and copper pieces and }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
an idea started to take shape. What if the giant rats had accumulated the treasure as part of their tribute to a Rat King at war with the Cat King? There were rat kings in medieval folkore, after all, as well as a Mouse King in }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
The Nutcracker}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
, so the idea wasn't without precedent. I let it simmer in the back of my mind until I needed it, as I'll explain in }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch

As a referee, I find it very easy to keep going back to same well for ideas. That's why I like random tables: they force me to grapple with results I would never come up with on my own. Had it not been for the 2000 copper pieces, }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
the spark of some important aspects of my ongoing campaign would never have come to be. It wasn't the only spark, but it played a role. That's one of the lessons I learned early on: you never know what might inspire you. Going into dungeon creation with a \u8220\'1cplan\u8221\'1d or \u8220\'1cvision\u8221\'1d beforehand might appear to lead to a more \u8220\'1ccoherent\u8221\'1d locale. In my experience, though, it made things more predictable and bland. I ended up abandoning many of my initial ideas after better ones emerged through }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
the interaction of randomness, the players' response to it, and my own ideas.}

49. I like unexplained\u8212\'14indeed unexplainable\u8212\'14events and effects. The temporal stasis effect in this room is something I simply thought would pique players' imaginations. I had no idea why it was operating when I keyed this room and still don't. I'm not really sure it matters, though if my players had taken a keen interest in it or started to theorize as to its origins, I might have given it some further thought. That's the way I do a lot of things as a referee: I come up with some vaguely defined notion and let the players loose on it. If it grabs their attention and they want to know more, I run with it; if they don't, I don't bother.}

51. The hoard here contains this level's new magic item: the rod of opening. I created it because there are a number of locked doors on this level and, at the time I created it, I didn't allow the thief class in the game. Consequently, I wanted to be sure there was some other means by which the characters might be able to open locked doors whose keys they didn't find. As it turned out, I changed my mind regarding the thief before the characters ever found this room or the rod of opening.}

56. When I started creating Dwimmermount, I was concerned about the how tedious it might for the characters to have to work their way down through many levels every time they returned to the dungeon after leaving it to re-supply. That's when the notion of an elevator came to me. I liked it not only for the ease with which the characters could potentially reach a lower level, but also for the \u8220\'1chigh tech\u8221\'1d quality it lent to the place. I wanted to hit home that Dwimmermount was the product of an earlier age, when magic functioned as technology and something like an elevator seemed a simple but effective way to do that.}

In play, the elevator only ever led to Level 4. What is now known as Level 0 never had a formal location in the dungeon. I'd come up with the idea of the place and wanted to put it somewhere, but never got around to doing so. When I gave some thought to it, the most logical location was above Level 1. It was then that I decided to make the elevator go up as well as down. }

68. As I pondered the wider world beyond Dwimmermount, I found myself in a quandary. I liked most of the monsters and races of classical D&D, but I nevertheless felt there were too many of them. Including them all without some sense of how they fit into the larger cosmology was a non-starter for me. Even if the players and their characters never knew any of this stuff, I wanted to know it. I felt it was important to being able to present a believable fantasy world. That's how I came up with the idea of beast men (see Room 3), for example.}

In a similar vein, I wanted to include gnomes. I liked the traditional portrayal of gnomes in D&D as smaller, magical dwarves, but it never made sense to me that they were a separate race. So, I decided to make them \u8220\'1cmutant\u8221\'1d dwarves, a rare good result of dwarven reproduction gone awry. I thought that better grounded gnomes in the overall setting, as well as providing yet more depth to the weird way dwarves reproduced. Moreover, the idea of gnomes being an offshoot of dwarves is mentioned parenthetically in Supplement I to OD&D, so I figured I was on solid ground.}
