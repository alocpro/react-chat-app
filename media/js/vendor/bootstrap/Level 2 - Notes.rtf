2. I love random effects. My love of them almost certainly stems from the infamous Room of Pools in Mike Carr's }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
In Search of the Unknown}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
, the very first D&D module I ever owned. I have fond memories running my friends through that module and watching them test each pool to try and figure out what its effects might be before drinking from it. Consequently, there are quite a few rooms in Dwimmermount in a similar vein.}

5. Before I ever played D&D, I played David Megarry's Dungeon! boardgame. I remember many things about that game, but what I recall most vividly are the monster cards. The cards that most delighted my friends and I were the ones for green slime and black pudding\u8212\'14two monsters that seemed bizarre to us at the time. Once I read my first D&D rulebook, I discovered more about these monsters and came to develop a fascination with them. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there are lots of slimy creatures in Dwimmermount.}

14. When I first started playing D&D, mapping out the dungeon was deemed an important activity. If you didn't have an accurate map, you might not be able to find your way out again. Likewise, mapping made it easier to intuit the location of secret doors, hidden rooms, and similar such features. Mapping, though, is a hard sell to many contemporary players. I didn't want to force the practice on my players, but I did want to encourage and reward it. So, when I started putting Dwimmermount together, I included numerous rooms that, though separated by distance, nevertheless had connections that became more obvious if you took the time to make a map. }

Room 14 is located right next to Room 9, but, since it's a hidden room, its connection to it might not be as apparent if you didn't look at it on the map. At least, that was my intention, though, in play, it wasn't as clear as I had hoped. }

15. I got tired of hearing from D&D players about \u8220\'1cuseless\u8221\'1d spells that no cleric or magic-user would ever want to memorize. A good example of this is the 1st-level magic-user spell }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch

, which is actually extremely useful. The problem seems to be that many referees don't make an effort to include obstacles that can be overcome through the timely use of this spell. For that reason, there are quite a few places in the dungeon where the best\u8212\'14and in some cases only\u8212\'14solution is the use of a spell such as this.}

16. I was a big fan of James Ward's }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Gamma World }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
as a kid. It was the second RPG I ever played, after Dungeons & Dragons. In the post-apocalyptic world described in that game, many ancient facilities can only be entered through the use of appropriately color-coded I.D. cards. A similar conceit is present in Gary Gygax's module }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Expedition to the Barrier Peaks}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
 (which is no wonder, given the debt it owed to }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Gamma World}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
's predecessor game, }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Metamorphosis Alpha}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
, also by James Ward). Over the years, I often took inspiration from this idea in other games. Once Dwimmermount started to take on a lot of science fiction (or at least science fantasy) elements, I quickly hit upon the notion of including the equivalent of }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Gamma World}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
's I.D. cards, namely the Termaxian passkeys.}

Originally, I had grandiose ideas about a whole system of such passkeys, each \u8220\'1clevel\u8221\'1d distinguished from the others in some way. I wanted to make their discovery and use vital to advancement through the deeper levels of the dungeon, not to mention the operation of the magical machines and devices found therein. These ideas didn't last long. A combination of laziness on my part, disinterest on the part of my players, and the general feeling that collecting these passkeys wasn't as fun in practice as it was in theory resulted in my downplaying them considerably. The passkeys are still present and they're still useful, but they're not nearly as vital as I once envisaged. I don't regret changing my mind on this point. Many times I would come up with notions that didn't survive contact with the realities of play and I altered or abandoned them. To my mind, that's what good referees do.}

19. As a child, I was very interested in astronomy and astrophysics. Had I had any aptitude with mathematics, I might have gone into one of those fields, but, alas, I'm hopeless when it comes to numbers. In 1980, Carl Sagan's }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Cosmos }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
TV series kicked off and I was a big fan. I watched it with great enthusiasm and my aunt purchased the accompanying book for me. I still own that book and, even now, flipping through it conjures up some of the old feelings that series elicited in me way back then.}

In one of the episodes\u8212\'14I can't recall which one\u8212\'14Sagan talked about Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler. It was then that I first became aware of the existence of orreries, which are mechanical models of the solar system. I thought the very idea of such a thing was amazing. A couple of years later, I saw the movie, }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
The Dark Crystal}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
, in which a huge orrery was depicted. That fired my imagination even more! As science fiction/science fantasy came to play a bigger role in Dwimmermount, I drew on my memories of both }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Cosmos }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
and }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
The Dark Crystal}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
 and decided to include an orrery. (As it turns out, there are two orreries in Dwimmermount, though the second one, on what is now Level 0, is of a somewhat different nature).}

20. }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Gamma World }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
and matters post-apocalyptic intrude once more. When I refereed }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Gamma World}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
, one of the most fun aspects of it was watching my friends try to puzzle out what a piece of ancient technology did, based on my descriptions of them. In most cases, I tried hard to conceal an item's true function by describing it as someone unfamiliar with its use might see it. I didn't always succeed in this endeavor and sometimes my friends would become frustrated with what they felt was my deliberate vagueness. Even so, I found it fun.}

My notion of what Eldritch (and, before that, Great Ancient) devices were like was strongly influenced by my experiences playing }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Gamma World}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
, which only made sense, since most fantasy worlds are post-apocalyptic ones. That may seem like a strange notion, but it isn't. Consider: most fantasy worlds postulate a past \u8220\'1cGolden Age,\u8221\'1d which was better in every way than the present. It was during this time when great monuments were built and great discoveries were made. Everything that has come since is but a pale reflection of those Days of Glory. When you remember that many learned people during the European Middle Ages felt the same about their time when they compared it to the Classical civilization that preceded it, it makes sense that many fantasy roleplaying worlds had inherited this perspective.}

21. While I'm the last person to argue in favor of the ridiculous proposition that \u8220\'1cmonsters are people, too,\u8221\'1d I do sometimes think that players are regularly ignore the value of parleying even with hated enemies. I tried to include lots of opportunities throughout the dungeon where the characters might encounter monsters or NPCs with whom they could interact in ways other than through violence. I also made regular use of morale rules, so that monsters might run away in the face of superior opposition rather than fight till the death. This worked out very well in play and led to a number of interesting situations that otherwise might not have\u8212\'14bargaining with evil anthropomorphic boards, for instance!}

22. As the campaign developed and I got a better sense of what I wanted to do, I started coming up with lots of \u8220\'1csecrets\u8221\'1d or \u8220\'1cmysteries\u8221\'1d that I wanted that characters to uncover in the course of their explorations. In a number of cases, I was quite proud of these things and wanted to ensure the characters eventually learned them. At the same time, I feel quite strongly that the value of a secret/mystery is heavily dependent on the difficulty in discovering it. This put me in a funny place\u8212\'14simultaneously wanting to preserve the secrets and wanting them to revealed.}

I never really resolved this conflict in my mind. Throughout the entirety of the time I was refereeing my campaign, I was genuinely torn, particularly over secrets like the origin of the dwarves. That's why I frequently created NPCs who knew a little more than the characters and could thus lead them by the nose a bit when I felt frustrated by their seeming lack of inquisitiveness. Glandal and Thoon were intended to know a bit more about dwarven history and to push the characters in the right direction. That didn't happen for a number of reasons, chiefly that I chickened out in the end. As much as I wanted to \u8220\'1ctell all,\u8221\'1d I couldn't bring myself to do it when push came to shove. Consequently, the secret of dwarven origins was never discovered in my original campaign.}

25. The mythology of Turms Termax evolved greatly during the course of the campaign. As I noted in the comments to Level 1, a big influence on my conception of him were Richard L. Tierney's stories about Simon of Gitta (aka Simon Magus of the Acts of the Apostles). Tierney re-imagines Simon as a Gnostic philosopher and magician who does battle with the horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos in his quest for personal enlightenment. Since Simon is the protagonist, he is portrayed somewhat heroically, especially when compared to the Romans who are his frequent adversaries.}

I wasn't interested in portraying Turms as a hero. I'd already established early on that he was something of a villain\u8212\'14or at least a self-interested rogue. Plus, there was something satisfying in the way I'd established the magic-using Eldritch Empire falling before the might of the god-fearing Thulians, which in turn was corrupted from within by the magic-using Termaxians. Still, Tierney's Simon was a compelling character and I wanted to borrow elements from him. }

One element I did borrow\u8212\'14also present in other tales of Simon Magus\u8212\'14was his \u8220\'1csoul mate,\u8221\'1d Helen. Helen is the incarnation of the divine female principle (Sophia) and Simon's aid in his ascent to godhood. Since Turms was also going to be obsessed with finding a way to achieve immortality, I thought it only made sense that he, too, would have a female companion. I decided to use a similar method in coming up with her name as I had with Turms itself. In this case, I looked at the etymology of \u8220\'1cHelen\u8221\'1d and learned that one possible origin is the Indo-European adjective }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
sarana}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
 (which means \u8220\'1cswift,\u8221\'1d as I recall). Sarana sounded like a plausible female name and so I went with it.}

I never developed the character of Sarana very much, since her legend didn't figure prominently in the campaign. I later imagined that she was one of the Terrim (see Level 9), but that's an idea that never made any impact on the campaign and so I consider it only one possible explanation for who Sarana was and what her role in the story of Turms Termax might have been. }

28. I used most of the monsters found in OD&D when populating Dwimmermount. However, I regularly tried to put my own spin on them. One monster with which I did this was the ghoul. A recurring theme in the campaign was the finality of death and the possibility of immortality. A great many of the campaign's mysteries focuses on such matters, including, as I've noted, that of Turms Termax. When I got around to re-imagining ghouls, I saw them as Men who sought to achieve immortality through the consumption of human flesh. They were individuals who had willingly become cannibals\u8212\'14and necrophages \u8211\'13 in order to achieve undeath. This isn't an original idea. I'm certain I was heavily influenced by H.P. Lovecraft's conception of ghouls in coming up with this idea.}

35. As a rule, I don't fret too much about the practical aspects of dungeon life. I tend more toward the \u8220\'1cmythic underworld\u8221\'1d conception that Jason \u8220\'1cPhilotomy Jurament\u8221\'1d Cone popularized through his OD&D Musings web page.  Nevertheless, I still wanted to make an effort to include rooms, such as latrines, pantries, and dormitories, since Dwimmermount was supposed to have been a fortress in ancient times. I suspect I was more consistent about this on the early levels than I was on later ones.}

38. I wanted to convey that Thulian civilization (and, before it, that of the Eld and the Great Ancients) was more advanced than the one that arose in its immediately aftermath (i.e. the current campaign setting). I didn't want to do this by making every piece of equipment the characters encountered explicitly magical, let alone high-tech. I wasn't always sure how to do this, so I experimented with different approaches. One of them led to the creation of various \u8220\'1cThulian\u8221\'1d items, such as the Thulian crossbow, which is a kind of \u8220\'1cmagic item lite.\u8221\'1d I'm not convinced these items served the purpose I had in mind, but that's one of those things you can only discover by trial and error.}

44. The glow bulbs are another example of my attempts to portray Thulian civilization as an advanced one. The glow bulbs are simply oversized light bulbs of unusual design. They were never much used in the campaign as means of illumination. They were, however, used as incendiary devices.}

You'll note that I don't mention in my key exactly how many glow bulbs are in each box or how many boxes there are. I won't say that was deliberate, because it wasn't.

46. Again, probably owing to my love of }{\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Gamma World}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
, I like the notion of mutagenic substances. I wanted to include magical mutagens in Dwimmermount. Since I'd already established the existence of azoth, it was a small leap to imagine that it had mutagenic effects on living things, in addition to its other effects. To emphasize this, I conceived of some rooms filled with plants exposed to azoth. These plants would be \u8220\'1calive\u8221\'1d after the fashion of so many pulp fantasies\u8212\'14reacting to the presence of the characters and attacking them when they came close.}

49. This is another example (like the dwarves in Room 22) of where I placed some knowledgeable NPCs through whom I could convey background information to the characters. In this case, the two characters I included were Termaxian cultists who'd been trapped in Dwimmermount since its fall. As with the dwarves, I didn't wind up using these cultists in that fashion. In fact, I didn't use them at all! I realized that the characters in my campaign weren't likely to interact positively with Colluthus and Arethusa, since they had come to be strongly opposed to the Termaxians. Moreover, I worried that it'd be too easy to reveal more information than I wanted through them. Since they were actually in Dwimmermount at the time of its fall, they might too easily \u8220\'1cspill the beans\u8221\'1d about its past.}

So, when the players reached this room, I got rid of the Termaxians and replaced them instead with Dr Mason Halsey, a displaced human scientist from our Earth. Halsey was a researcher on Project Phoenix, a US government endeavor designed to open portals to other worlds. Displaced Earthmen are common protagonists in a lot of the pulp fantasy fiction that inspired D&D. I even created a character class\u8212\'14the Stranger\u8212\'14that was intended to emulate this literary archetype. I thought it would fun to include such a character in Dwimmermount, too.}

The advantage of Dr Halsey was that, as an outsider, he would have no idea about Dwimmermount's history. Indeed, he had no idea about where he was or how he got here. His purpose in the campaign was twofold. First, I simply wanted to indulge my own fancy. Second, I wanted to set the stage for some additional \u8220\'1chigh level\u8221\'1d revelations about the campaign setting. At that time, I was toying with the notion that Telluria (as I called the setting) was our Earth in the very future, after some kind of techno-magical apocalypse. I abandoned that notion eventually, but it was something I seriously considered at one point and Dr Halsey was to be a big part of revealing it. I was reading a lot of Jack Vance and Clark Ashton Smith when I came up with this, so this seemed like a logical development to me.}

Like so many aspects of my campaign, though, it faded away over time. Once I rejected the Telluria-as-future-Earth idea, Dr Halsey ceased to have any meaningful role. I didn't formally get rid of him, but he appeared less and less in our sessions. Eventually, he was largely forgotten. In retrospect, I feel bad about this, but that's the way I run my campaigns. Sometimes an idea takes hold and I run with it and sometimes it doesn't. This was a case where it didn't.}

50. When I read about the dungeons where D&D was born\u8212\'14Castles Blackmoor and Greyhawk\u8212\'14what always struck me about them was how many locations they had that players not only continued to talk about after the fact but that their characters returned to again and again. I knew I wanted to include lots of such rooms in Dwimmermount. The Pool of Life was intended to be such a room. I hoped the players would find it intriguing and experiment with its operation. They did do this, though not as often as I imagined they would, but then that's a constant thread in these comments.}

The Pool was (of course) intended as yet another illustration of the magical technology found throughout the dungeon. It was also meant as a rather explicit explanation for the existence of the various beast-men (like orcs and gnolls). Despite my regular desire to \u8220\'1creveal all\u8221\'1d through the mouths of various NPCs, I preferred to use a \u8220\'1cshow, don't tell\u8221\'1d approach when it came to conveying information like this.

The magician Varazes is a Volmarian, from a Thulian successor state to the south of the main campaign area.

I also liked him, because he introduced some nuance into my portrayal of the Volmarians. As I stated in my comments on Level 1, I initially conceived of the Volmarians as wholly sinister. Over time, though, I softened my stance and wanted to show that not all Volmarians were cut from the same cloth.

Dusty knew a bit about Dwimmermount, but his information was somewhat out of date, since he's been held in that jar for two centuries. What he really wanted, though, was to return to the City-State of Adamas, where he hoped to return to the court of the Cat King. Mention of the Cat King intrigued the characters, who'd never heard of such a personage before\u8212\'14perfectly reasonable, since I only just invented him! As I mentioned in the comments to Room 46 on Level 1, I looked to the beast lords of Michael Moorcock's Elric stories for my initial inspiration, but I quickly moved beyond that, since Moorcock's conceptions didn't quite fit with the kind of world I was trying to present.}

The characters visited the King of Cats many times, often bargaining with him for information in exchange for aiding cats in need of assistance in Adamas and other locales. I'm personally not very fond of cats, so I tended to portray the King as venal, vain, and selfish. He kept mice and }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
birds}{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
 in cages around his throne, which was a pile of pillows up in the attic of }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
the Doomed Lion tavern. Other cats served him and there would sometimes be delegations from other animals who wanted to enlist the aid of the cats.}

This is when the idea of the Rat Boss started to appear in my imagination. I conceived of him as the rodent counterpart of the Cat King, though more along the lines of a mafia }{\i0\ai0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
boss (hence his title). He was completely untrustworthy and the characters knew it, but he was a lot of fun to roleplay. He had a daughter named Muriel who was a wererat. The characters rescued her when she was being held captive by some Termaxian agents who wanted to impress the Rat Boss and his minions into their service. }

I offhandedly mentioned the existence of a Dog King, too, but the characters never encountered him.}
