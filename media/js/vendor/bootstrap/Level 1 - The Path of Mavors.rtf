These heads are not original and a successful force doors check can remove them (see page XX for more information). A sixth statue depicts an attractive but hard-faced woman.

\pard\pardeftab709\sa120

\f0 \cf0 Voices emanate from this room. They speak an archaic form of Low Thulian (Common) and discuss mundane military matters. The speakers are four Thulian soldiers, who take no notice of anyone who enters. The soldiers appear shadowy and completely lacking in substance. Neither physical nor magical means can harm them. They are not undead but the psychic \'93echoes\'94 of soldiers who died in Dwimmermount.

\i\b\fs28 \cf0 15. Chamber of Memories
\i0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab709\sa120

\f0 \cf0 This chamber contains six stone pedestals that stand about four feet in height scattered about the room. At the base of each pedestal is a metal plate. Placing at least one foot on a plate activates a magical effect that transmits moving images and sounds into the person's mind.

\pard\pardeftab709\sa120

\f0\b \cf0 Memory 1: 
\b0  A massive pitched battle between Thulian armies and the orcs and demons commanded by the Red Elves.

\f0\b Memory 2: 
\b0 Fighting in the corridors of Dwimmermount, as the Thulians clear it of its Chaotic defenders.
\f1 \

\f0\b Memory 3: 
\b0 A visit from the Thulian emperor and his entourage.
\f1 \

\f0\b Memory 4:

\f1 \

\f0\b Memory 5: 
\b0 Scenes of other magic-users commanding soldiers as they go into battle.
\f1 \

\f0\b Memory 6: 
\b0 Soldiers around a large table in the center of which is a head of a bearded man made from bronze. The head looks like the heads of Turms Termax seen throughout this level of Dwimmermount.

\i0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab709\sa120

\f0 \cf0 This empty room contains empty weapons racks, along with the usual dust and cobwebs. Three dwarves lies dead in this room. Their corpses are stony, like those seen elsewhere.

\i\b\fs28 \cf0 17. Training Room
\i0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab709\sa120

\f0 \cf0 Thulian soldiers trained in this room. It contains nine mechanical apparatuses that each hold a sword and shield. On the western wall is a control panel with a series of 10 switches. If a character activates one of the switches, roll a die. A roll of 1 through 9 activates apparatuses equal to the result. They move about the room on grooves on the floor, swinging their swords. A result of 10 shuts down any active apparatuses.
\f1 \

\f0 The apparatuses are not intelligent and cannot leave the grooves, which run north to south, with three per row. They have AC 8 and deal 1\'966 points of damage per successful hit, striking as 1 HD creatures. While even one apparatus is in operation, the door locks and does not open again, except by magic or picking the lock.

\i0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab709\sa120

\f0 \cf0 This room was once a laboratory of some sort. There is a long, metal-reinforced wooden table here, covered in stains in a variety of colors. Along the walls are many metallic shelves, some of which are also stained. Strewn about the room are shards of glass. There is also evidence of other wooden furniture having once been here, but it is now reduced to rotten splinters.

\i0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab709\sa120

\f0 \cf0 This chamber once held a small library of scrolls and codices of a military or historical nature. Now, the metal shelves that line the walls are sparse. The remaining texts are completely valueless and/or crumble to dust if a character touches them. The exceptions are the following:

\i0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab709\sa120

\f0 \cf0 This room once held crates of supplies. Now, it serves as the lair of 11 kobolds sent to explore the rest of Dwimmermount by the Spawn of Arach-Nacha (see Room 41). Other than the short swords they wield, the kobolds have only 18 cp apiece, some threadbare blankets, and dried rat meat for food.

\i\b\fs28 \cf0 21. Workshop
\i0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab709\sa120

\f0 \cf0 This room contains a large metal table and lots of metal shelves. Along the south wall are three unusual metal \'93boxes\'94 festooned with knobs and dials. The boxes are hollow and stand a little over four feet tall. They are warm to the touch. The floor immediately around them is charred and stained with silvery, metallic splotches. Anyone who fiddles with the knobs and dials causes a box to activate with a loud whirring sound that lasts for 1\'964 rounds. Roll for wandering monsters each round it is active. An activated box shoots out a jet of steam that deals 1\'9610 damage to anyone standing immediately in front of the box. A successful saving throw versus dragon breath reduces the damage by half.

\i0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab709\sa120

\f0 \cf0 This large room is bereft of any furnishings. There are marks on the floor and walls indicating that there were such things in the room at one time in the past. The room is not dusty nor is there much in the way of debris here. The floor of the eastern two-thirds of the room has been coated with a thick layer of oil that is visible if a character gets within 10 feet of it. The oil is flammable and is part of the kobolds' defense of their caverns (see Room 23).

\f0 \cf0 10 kobolds stand watch here. Besides their swords and bows, they have torches, which they will throw into Room 22 to ignite the oil covering its floor. They will then attack any opponents not killed or driven away by the flames with their bows. Each kobold possesses 22 cp.

\i\b\fs28 \cf0 28. The Moon Pool
\i0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab709\sa120

\f0 \cf0 This unoccupied cave has a small opening in its roof through which moonlight can shine, reflecting in the nearby pool. The pool holds what alchemists call "true water," a liquid untainted by physical contaminants. Nothing can destroy true water or alter its state. Thus, it does not evaporate and even the mightiest spells cannot freeze it. True water is a supernatural solvent, dissolving magical energies within itself.
\f1 \
\

\f0 In the case of the Moon Pool, the magical energies it dissolves are moon rays, called "lunar emanations" by sages. Living beings who partake of the Pool's contents can imbibe these rays. The rays boost\'97or diminish\'97magical potency, according to the current phase of the moon. Drinking from the Moon Pool has the following effects:

\f0 \cf0 A character who drinks from the Moon Pool must make a saving throw against spells. Success indicates that the effect listed above occurs, according to the current phase of the moon. The effect lasts for a number of days equal to 1 plus the difference between the saving throw number and the number rolled. For example, a 6th-level magic-user requires a 12 to save against spells. If his player rolls 14, the appropriate effect lasts for 3 days. Failure provides no effect. Later drinks have no effect for a number of days equal to the amount by which the character failed his saving throw. While one effect is operative, later drinks provide no effect, good or bad. Finally, no known means can dispel the Moon Pool's effects. A character who has drunk from its waters must wait until the appropriate number of days has passed before its effects will fade. 
\f1 \

\f0 "+1 caster level" means that, for spells that have variable effects based on level (e.g. fireball), the caster is treated as one level higher than he is. "+1 spell" means the character gains a bonus spell of the type indicated for the duration the Moon Pool's infused water is in effect. Effects stated as a penalty (e.g. "\'961 caster level") function in reverse.

These six bubbles consist of the same material and may pop if anyone touches or comes near them. Any character coming within 5 feet of a bubble must make a saving throw versus wands. Failure causes the bubble to pop, dealing 1\'966 damage to everyone in a 5-foot radius. There is a 2 in 6 chance that the popping of a bubble will set off another one.

If anyone comes within 5 feet of the face, its mouth begins to move slightly and unintelligible sounds emanate from it. Should anyone apply oil or some other lubricant to the corners of the face's mouth, it opens more widely and speaks clearly. It says, in ancient Thulian, \'93Ask a question but only one, I'll answer truthfully and then am done.\'94 If the question is in ancient Thulian, he face will answer truthfully to the best of its knowledge. It knows only about this level and its information is out of date, so the referee should bear this in mind when crafting a reply. If a character asks about something the face does not know, it will say so, but such a question counts toward the one it will answer. If asked any more questions after the first, it will reply, again in ancient Thulian, \'93Go away, I shall not answer again today.\'94 A character can ask again in 24 hours.

\i0  (see page XX), but he no longer has it memorized. He entered Dwimmermount a few days ago with a party of dwarves. They were following rumors that there might be a dwarf cemetery within the mountain fortress. He and his companions never found the cemetery but were instead ambushed by orcs. He is, so far as he knows, the sole survivor of his party. He will pay 500 gp if anyone helps him escape this place.
